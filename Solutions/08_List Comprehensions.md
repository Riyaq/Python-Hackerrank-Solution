**Concept:** <br>

List comprehensions are a concise and expressive way to create or transform lists in Python. They allow you to generate a new list by applying an expression to each item in an existing iterable (like a list, tuple, or range) in a single line of code. List comprehensions can replace traditional for loops that append to a list, often making the code shorter and more readable.

-------------------------------------------------
**Code when we don't use list comprehension-**
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    x = int(input())
    y = int(input())
    z = int(input())
    n = int(input())

    ar = []
    p = 0

    for i in range(x + 1):
        for j in range(y + 1):
            for k in range(z + 1):
                if i + j + k != n:
                    ar.append([])
                    ar[p] = [i, j, k]
                    p += 1
    print(ar)
```
Explanation:<br>
```
ar = []
p = 0
```
<mark>ar</mark> is an empty list that will store the result (a list of lists).<br>
<mark>p</mark> is used as an index to keep track of the position in ar when appending new lists.
