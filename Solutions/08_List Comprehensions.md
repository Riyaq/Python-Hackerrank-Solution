List comprehensions are a concise and expressive way to create or transform lists in Python. They allow you to generate a new list by applying an expression to each item in an existing iterable (like a list, tuple, or range) in a single line of code. List comprehensions can replace traditional for loops that append to a list, often making the code shorter and more readable.
